# This is just a test to see if I can outline something for Hunter to utilize
- Brainstorm some things for him
    - Access to github to allow us to colloborate, have Hunter create a github account
    - Grant him access to your repositories
    - Have Hunter install visual studio code and the Python extensions
    - Do an initial session where we will get familiar with visual studio code and pulling a repository
